Rombitz: Galactic Investigator
==============
This site will host news and information regarding the ongoing development of the game.

## News
Version 0.1.1 Released 6/24/12

***

### Downloading and Saving the File
Just click [here](https://github.com/downloads/Pengor/Text-Adventure/TextAdventure_0_1_1.jar) to download the game file. Find a good place to save the file, you will need to remember the location later. I recommend creating a new folder called "Rombitz" in your downloads folder so that you can store later versions of the game in the same place.

### Running the Game
1. Launch Command Prompt or Terminal (depending on your computer).
2. Navigate to the folder where you saved the file. You should have named it Rombitz. On Windows, if you don't know how to do this, see [here](http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-to-use-dos-command-prompt/).
3. Type: java -jar TextAdventure_0_1_1.jar
4. The game will open in the same window, enjoy!
